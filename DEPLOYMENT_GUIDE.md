# Netlify Deployment Guide for HookAI

## Quick Deployment Steps

1. **Connect Repository to Netlify**
   - Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com)
   - Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
   - Connect your GitHub repository

2. **Build Configuration**
   The netlify.toml file is already configured with:
   ```
   [build]
     base = "client"
     command = "npm ci && npm run build"
     publish = "client/dist"
   ```

3. **Environment Variables** (if needed)
   - No environment variables required for the current setup
   - Webhook integration uses direct HTTP calls

4. **Domain Configuration**
   - Use the provided `.netlify.app` domain
   - Or configure a custom domain in Netlify settings

## Build Process Fixed

✅ **Removed TypeScript compilation step** - Faster builds
✅ **Standalone client configuration** - Independent package.json
✅ **Proper CSS loading** - All Tailwind styles included
✅ **Client-side routing** - _redirects file configured
✅ **Mobile optimization** - Responsive design fixes applied

## Webhook Integration

- **Make.com webhook**: `https://hook.us2.make.com/zgk94s652bfrodb93eudl9rjsiay0524`
- **Data format**: Plain text strings for each form field
- **Local storage backup**: Automatic data persistence

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check the build logs in Netlify dashboard
2. Verify all dependencies are listed in client/package.json
3. Ensure the base directory is set to "client"

The CSS loading issues that caused the broken UI have been resolved with proper build configuration and asset handling.
