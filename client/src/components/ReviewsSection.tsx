      comment: "The sales funnel they built for my life coaching practice has been a complete game changer. I was manually following up with every lead before, which was exhausting and time-consuming.\n\nNow the system handles most of the nurturing automatically. My discovery call booking rate went from maybe 20% to over 65%. The automated email sequence is incredibly well-written and feels personal. I've been able to scale my practice without burning out, and my monthly revenue has increased by 180% in just 6 months.",

      comment: "As a business coach, I needed something to help qualify leads before they got on my calendar. The AI assistant they set up asks all the right questions and provides immediate value to prospects.\n\nIt saves me probably 12 hours a week screening calls. Only serious, qualified prospects make it through now. My conversion rate to paying clients has more than doubled, and the quality of leads is significantly higher. The system even handles basic objections and builds trust before prospects ever speak to me directly.",

      comment: "I run a wellness coaching business and was struggling to get my content seen on social media. The viral clips service took my hour-long workshops and transformed them into these powerful, bite-sized videos.\n\nMy Instagram following grew from 800 to over 15,000 in 5 months. More importantly, I'm getting actual high-quality coaching clients from the content now. Three of my current $5k package clients came directly from viral clips. The editing quality is professional and they really understand what resonates in the coaching space.",

The booking calendar integration works flawlessly and my clients love the clean, professional design.\n\nThe client portal where they can access resources and track progress has been a huge hit. Bookings are definitely up since the launch - about 40% increase in the first quarter. The mobile experience is excellent too, which is important since many of my clients book on their phones. Support team was patient with all my questions during the transition.",
